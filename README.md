# Bellabeat-Case-Study

In this case study, we work for a fictional company bellabeat which manufactures fitness products specially designed for women. 

Our aim is to find how customers use their smart devices(in this case study - fitbit) in order to unlock new growth opportunities. This will help guide marketing strategy and in turn lead to upsacaling of busines.

I gave used R and SQL for data cleaning and analysis and used R libraries for visualizing data.
